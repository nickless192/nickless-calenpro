# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description
Nickless CalenPro allows you to view your daily set tasks from 9am to 5pm. The current date will be displayed on top at all times. Color-coding allows you to determine your progress through the day:

* Tasks in grey are already in the past;

* Tasks in red at being executed at the moment or require inmediate attention;

* Tasks in green will be executed in the future.

By clicking on the task box for a specific time will turn it into an text area element to allow for modifications of the task descrition. At this moment, if the Save button is pressed, then the text is saved to the page and to the localStorage.
